<Step label="1">

### Make sure your module's `expo-module.config.json` uses the `"apple"` platform

Expo SDK 50 introduced a universal `"apple"` platform to indicate that the module supports any of the Apple platform.
If you have used `"ios"` before, you can safely replace it.

```diff expo-module.config.json
{
-   "platforms": ["ios"],
-   "ios": {
-     "modules": ["MyModule"]
-   }
+   "platforms": ["apple"],
+   "apple": {
+     "modules": ["MyModule"]
+   }
}
```

</Step>
<Step label="2">

### Update the podspec to declare support for other platforms

```diff Module's podspec
- s.platform       = :ios, '13.4'
+ s.platforms = {
+   :ios => '13.4',
+   :tvos => '13.4',
+   :osx => '10.15'
+ }
```

</Step>

<Step label="3">

### Set up `react-native-macos` or `react-native-tvos` in the app

If you are writing a local module, your app is probably already set up. Otherwise, you
If you are writing a standalone (non-local) module, you may want to set up the example app to support these platforms.

- **For macOS**: follow the official [Install React Native for macOS](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnm-getting-started#install-the-macos-extension) guide from `react-native-macos` documentation.
- **For tvOS**: follow the instructions in the [react-native-tvos](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos) repository.

<Step label="4">

### Review the code for using APIs not supported on these platforms

Platform APIs may differ between Apple platforms. The most noticeable difference comes from using different UI frameworks â€“ `UIKit` on iOS and tvOS, `AppKit` on macOS.

Both `react-native-macos` and `expo-modules-core` provide some aliases and polyfills so that you can reference to `UIKit` classes on macOS target (for example `UIView` is an alias to `NSView`, `UIApplication` is an alias to `NSApplication`),
but it's usually not enough for iOS-first libraries to support other platforms out of the box. You may need to write conditionally compiled code that uses different implementations depending on the platform.

```swift
#if os(iOS)
  // iOS implementation
#elseif os(macOS)
  // macOS implementation
#elseif os(tvOS)
  // tvOS implementation
#endif
```
